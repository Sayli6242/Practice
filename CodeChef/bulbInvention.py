"""
Now Chef has worked on multiple search algorithms to optimize search. 
For this project, he uses a modulo-based search algorithm that he invented himself. 
So first he chooses an integer K and selects all indices i in increasing order such that
imodK=0 and test the gases on such indices,
then all indices 
ï¿½
i in increasing order such that imodK=1, and test the gases on such indices, and so on.

Given N, the index of the gas p that will work, and K, find after how much time will he be able to give
Chefland a new invention assuming that testing 1 gas takes 1 day.
