"""
King loves to go on tours with his friends.

King has N cars that can seat 5 people each and M cars that can seat 7 people each. 
Determine the maximum number of people that can travel together in these cars.

Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M â€” the number of 5-seaters and 7-seaters, respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the maximum number of people that can travel together.
