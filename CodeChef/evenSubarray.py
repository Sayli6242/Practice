"""
ou are given an integer NN. Consider the sequence containing the integers 1, 2, \ldots, N1,2,â€¦,N in increasing order (each exactly once). Find the maximum length of its contiguous subsequence with an even sum.

Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer --- the maximum length of a contiguous subsequence with even sum.
