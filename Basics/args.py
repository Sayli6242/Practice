# Write a Python program to get a string made of the first 2 and the last 2 chars from a given a string. If the string length is less than 2, return instead of the empty string. Go to the editor
# Sample String : 'w3resource'
# Expected Result : 'w3ce'
# x = "w3resource"
# print(x[:2], x[-2:])




# x = "restart"
# new = x.replace("r", "$", 5)
# print(new)
