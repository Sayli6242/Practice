# Given a number N.Find the maximum possible LCM that can be attained by any three numbers less than or equal to N.
# Note- LCM stands for Lowest Common Multiple. Also, Numbers can be repeated.

1) Pick any 3 random numbers by using random module.
2) store them in a list
3) iterate list to get each element in a list.
4) find LCM of each number 
5) compare maimum LCM of each number to one another
6) print maximum element.
